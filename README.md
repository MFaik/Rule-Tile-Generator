(or you can just check the [Everest API](https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Custom-Tilesets))

2) After importing the spritesheet in unity with the sprite mode set to multiple you can just slice it (make sure Keep Empty Rects is checked) 

3) When the sprite sheet is ready, right click the sprite and click Create > Rule Tile from Multiple Sprite

... and you are done.
